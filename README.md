# Description

Usually, people have less than a minute to impress whoever they are talking to. Therefore, it is important to utilize this small window of opportunity to get those we are talking to to have a positive perception of us and whatever we are addressing. This pitching up allows people to prepare for such circumstances. Users of this web application can post their pitches (could be elevator pitches, interview pitches, pickup lines, and puns) and allows other users to comment or vote for them. This gives the person posting the pitch an idea of whether the pitch is good or not.
